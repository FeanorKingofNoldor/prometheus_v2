"""Prometheus v2 – Monitoring logging setup.

This module provides a tiny helper to ensure monitoring components use
Prometheus's central logging configuration.

In early iterations, all logging is handled via :mod:`prometheus.core.logging`;
this module simply exposes a convenience function that can be imported
by monitoring scripts or the monitoring web API.
