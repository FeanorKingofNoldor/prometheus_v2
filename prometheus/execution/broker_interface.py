"""Prometheus v2 – Execution broker interface abstractions.

This module defines the core broker-facing data structures and an
abstract :class:`BrokerInterface` used by both live/paper trading and the
backtesting ``BacktestBroker``.

The API is intentionally minimal and mode-agnostic so that portfolio and
backtesting code can interact with the same interface regardless of
whether orders are routed to a real broker or a simulated market.
