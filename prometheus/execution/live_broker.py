"""Prometheus v2 – LiveBroker stub implementation.

This module defines :class:`LiveBroker`, a concrete
:class:`~prometheus.execution.broker_interface.BrokerInterface` intended
for LIVE trading against a real broker (e.g. IBKR Gateway/TWS).

For now this implementation is a *safe stub*:

* It provides the full BrokerInterface surface.
* All broker-facing methods raise ``NotImplementedError`` with a clear
  message indicating that real connectivity must be implemented in a
  deployment-specific adapter.

The goal is to:

* Keep the architecture and type surface consistent with the execution
  spec (015).
* Avoid accidentally routing real money orders through an incomplete
  implementation.

In later passes this module should be extended to wrap a concrete IBKR
adapter (or other broker) and to integrate tightly with the execution
storage helpers (orders/fills/executed_actions).
